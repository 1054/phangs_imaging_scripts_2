# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Here we define the absolute file paths for our pipeline processing. 
# 
# 'key_dir' is the root directory storing all the key files 
#   used by our pipeline. 
# 
# 'ms_root' is the root directory storing all the measurement sets. 
#   Set more than one 'ms_root' below to have multiple search paths 
#   for the measurement sets defined in the 'ms_key' below. These 
#   measurement sets need to be calibrated in advance, with the ALMA
#   calibration pipeline, e.g., "scriptForPI.py". 
# 
# 'cleanmask_root' is the root directory storing all the clean mask
#   fits cubes. These clean masks need to be created by our Clean 
#   Mask creation pipeline. 
# 
# 'singledish_root' is the root directory storing all the single dish
#   imaged fits cubes. These cubes need to be produced by our Total 
#   Power data reduction pipeline, if you have Total Power data. 
# 
# 'imaging_root' is the root directory to output our imaged CASA-format 
#   and fits cubes. 
# 
# 'postprocess_root' is the root directory to output our post-processed 
#   fits cubes. These cubes are convolved to round beam, corrected for 
#   primary beam, mosaicked, feathered with single dish image cubes, and  
#   convolved to various angular resolutions. 
# 
# 'product_root' is the root directory to output our fits image products. 
#   This includes the moment maps and signal masks. 
# 
# 'release_root' is the root directory to output our final data release 
#   contents.

# Here we define the data-file-related keys to be used in our pipeline.
# 
# These files should be stored under the above 'key_dir' path. 
#   The file names are hard-coded here but can be changed as long as
#   the definition here and the files under 'key_dir' are agreed. 
# 
# "ms_file_key.txt" defines each the target name, array tag, 
#   project tag and the relative file path of each measurement set.
# 
# "singledish_key.txt" defines the relative file path of each
#   single dish cube that we obtained from our Total Power pipeline. 
# 
# "cleanmask_key.txt" defines the relative file path of each
#   clean mask cube that we obtained from our Clean Mask creation 
#   after a first-pass processing without clean mask.

cleanmask_key        cleanmask_key.txt


# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Here we define the observation-related keys to be used in our pipeline.
# 
# "config_definitions.txt" defines the detailed parameters for making 
#   spectral lines and continuum products, interferometry imaging and 
#   feathering with single dish data. 
# 
# "target_definitions.txt" defines the observation and galaxy parameters, 
#   including a target name for each mosaicking observation, R.A., 
#   Dec. coordinates of the phase center of this observation, and galaxy 
#   system velocity and expected velocity width for the spectral lines. 
# 
# "linearmosaic_definitions.txt" defines the links from galaxy name to 
#   target name. Each target name corresponds to a different mosaicking 
#   observation of this galaxy. 
# 
# "dir_key.txt" defines the links from target name to galaxy name which 
#   will appear as the output sub-directory name to hold our products. 
# 
# "imaging_recipes.txt" defines the imaging recipes for each interferometry
#   config. 
# 
# "overrides.txt" defines more detailed parameters to override in 
#   interferometry imaging and linear mosaicking steps.
