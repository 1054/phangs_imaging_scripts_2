This is a current, informal list of known issues:

- Need to split the two part fields from project 925 into their
  separate parts for eventual processing together with any new 12m
  data this summer.

- The "calibrate_data" script is not functional yet. The biggest issue
  is how to call the pipeline. We think the right thing is to rename
  the piperestorescript and let the scriptForPI do the renaming via
  symbolic links. But since the ADR continues to be unsure if they
  want to do this, I haven't spent the day or three to get this up and
  running.

- Same issue: The flagging command handling isn't fully implemented
  yet. And a routine needs to be written to be sure that we back up
  the original flags. In some cases, especially Cycle 3, there are
  already user-supplied flags.

- The calibration script needs to be taught to use the casaversion to
  data set list that I made. This is pretty easy.

- A few clean masks have spurious blips towards the low channel
  numbers because the noise has a frequency dependence. We should be
  accounting for this in product creation, but I haven't worried about
  it at the clean mask stage. There shouldn't be any real issues
  related to this, it's just poor aesthetics.

- The convergence criteria remains a subject of debate inside the ADR
  team. We can implement whatever once we settle on it. I have the
  sense that we are heading towards a threshold of 0.5 or 1 sigma
  inside the "tight" mask with a small fractional threshold (0.1% or
  something) to avoid divergence. But this remains on the ADR "to do"
  list.

- The 7m and 12m deliveries are racing ahead of the total power. We
  can see a clear situation on the horizon where we have to decide how
  "science ready" we consider data without TP. Ugh.
