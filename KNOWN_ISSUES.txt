This is a current, informal list of known issues:

- Current known bug: my statwts cover the line and so are
  downweighting the centers in some cases. This may be causing some of
  the divergence that we see. Work on broader windows and a fitspw
  call that avoids the line in all cases.

- Divergence during the single scale clean can happen. NGC 1365
  suffers from this right now. I have not identified any other
  cases. In NGC 1365 the issue occurs in specific channels.

- At least one case, NGC 5128 (Cen A) does need continuum subtraction.

- The "calibrate_data" script should be functional but is not
  tested. The flagging command handling isn't fully implemented
  yet. And a routine needs to be written to be sure that we back up
  the original flags. In some cases, especially Cycle 3, there are
  already user-supplied flags.

- We need calibrate_data to be able to figure out the correct CASA
  version. There are some syntax differences and we could probably
  grep for these and be clever. Or we could just write a list. I
  recorded what I did in the SCIENCE_GOAL_KEY for a while.

- Clean masks aren't great yet - NGC 685, 3239, 4496a, 4941, 5042, and
  7456 are relatively faint and have visible emission outside the
  default mask. 

  NGC 1546 and 4826 are bright and need a closer look.

  NGC 4731 and 5643 have some signal that may be spurious floating
  around in the cube.

  From the cycle experience we know that we should just go ahead and
  identify the targets with very broad centers and make the clean mask
  very generous there. This should be written in using a list of these
  things.

- It's not super clear to me for the 7m case that we actually need a
  clean mask when we clean down to S/N ~ 4. Convergence doesn't take
  so long and masks seem as likely to create divergence as to avoid
  it.
