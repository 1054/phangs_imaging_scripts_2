###
# Mapping from configuration and product to clean recipes.
# 
# Column 1: Configuration ("all" is okay)
# Column 2: Product ("all_line", "all_cont" are okay)
# Column 3: What stage of the imaging process does this apply to? (all/dirty/multiscale/singlescale)
# Column 4: Name of the clean parameter file.

# ORDER IS VERY IMPORTANT HERE! The recipes are read in as lists,
# which are applied *in the order that they are read in. So a
# parameter in later recipe will override the same parameter in the
# earlier recipe.

# STEP has valid values for step are
# "all","dirty","multiscale","singlescale"
