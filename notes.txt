NGC 1300
--------

Two part mosaic. Will need to separate when we get the new 12m data.

NGC 1365
--------

Divergence is very bad for the 12m+7m case. I adjusted the imaging_key
to have a smallscalebias of 0.8 but even still, this issue
persists. Adjusting to pb limit of 0.5 also did not help. Visual
inspection says the issue is at the edges between pb=0.5 and 0.75, so
I will adjust the level to 0.75 and then rerun.

Even this still leads to divergence, just not as bad. Will adjust the
small scale bias even more. At 0.9 things finally converge, not
terrible but takes forever. The mask now needs a bit more space.

NGC 1433
--------

Two part jointly imaged mosaic with only 12m+7m data.

Something seems wrong with the maximum projected along the RA/Dec axes
- check carefully again for divergence?

NGC 1566
--------

Two part jointly imaged mosaic with only 12m+7m data.

This one shows some evidence in the 7m residuals of needing a bigger
clean mask at the edges of the spatial extent.

NGC 1672
--------

The central mask could needs to be extended a bit more in velocity to
encompass the full velocity extent of the nuclear burst.

NGC 3351
--------

The central mask could needs to be extended a bit more in velocity to
encompass the full velocity extent of the nuclear burst.

NGC 3627
--------

Again, the central mask needs to be extended - a general problem it
seems. This is visible in the north. Adding a few more channels of
expansion across the board may be the most sensible
idea. Alternatively, I could join the bright and fainter masks - the
issue is most clearly visible in the cases with bright but confined
emission.

The south looks fine.

NGC 5068
--------

North shows divergence near the edges in the multiscale clean. This
gets fixed by bringing the edges in to a limit of pb=0.5.

South does the same.

Still have trouble with coverage and the merge of the two. Look into
this for the 7m and then the 12m.

NGC 5128
--------

Shows some divergence towards the edge.

NGC 6744
--------

North shows divergence near the edges in multiscale clean. Pulling the
primary beam cutoff in to 0.5 fixes this, at least mostly.

South shows divergence near the edges in multiscale clean.
