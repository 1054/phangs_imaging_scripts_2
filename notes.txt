NGC 1300
--------

Two part mosaic. Will need to separate when we get the new 12m data.

NGC 1365
--------

Divergence mostly goes away with a clean mask in place, but in a few
places the residuals look pathological, still.

NGC 1433
--------

As above - two part jointly imaged mosaic.

NGC 1566
--------

As above - two part jointly imaged mosaic.

This one shows some evidence in the 7m residuals of needing a bigger
clean mask at the edges of the spatial extent.

NGC 1672
--------

The central mask could probably be extended a bit more in velocity.

NGC 3627
--------

The north went fine. I shifted the center and am rerunning.

The south suffers from some pathological divergence. Invesitgating.


NGC 4321
--------

The south part shows some pathological residuals. Trying to shift the
weight a little bit towards small scales. Just a shift to
smallscalebias=0.7 seems good enough.
