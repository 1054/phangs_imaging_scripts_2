NGC 1300
--------

The pb_limit = 0.75 creates a patchy pattern, implying uneven
sensitivity across the mosaic. Lowered the pb_limit to 0.5 in this
case to get a better coverage.

This is expected because this is one of the two part mosaics from the
7m that we're currently imaging jointly for convenience.

NGC 1433
--------

As above - two part jointly imaged mosaic.

NGC 1566
--------

As above - two part jointly imaged mosaic.

NGC 3627
--------

Divergence is a recurring problem. In the north part, the 7m alone
diverges. I will try shifting the frequency grid and removing the
clean mask.

NGC 4321
--------

The south part shows some pathological residuals. Trying to shift the
weight a little bit towards small scales. Just a shift to
smallscalebias=0.7 seems good enough.
